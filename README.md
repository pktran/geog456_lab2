For this assignment, I developed a crawler for geotagged tweets within the United States. I chose to use the same coordinates at two different time stamp: one in the afteroon (roughly around 2PM) and the other around the evening (around 7PM) on the same day. I wanted to compared tweets being made within the same during two different time period because different information/tweets can be gathered since people can have different moods, events, and opinions at different times of the day. 

Based on my location, these maps are geocoded locations where the tweets were made in the afternoon and evening (respectively):
